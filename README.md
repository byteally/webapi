Introduction to **WebApi**
--------------------------

[`Webapi`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webapi) is a Haskell library that lets you

  * Write web API services
  * Quickly build Haskell client for existing API services
  * Generate API console interface for your web API ([coming soon](https://github.com/byteally/webapi-console))
  * Generate a mock server that can mock your responses and requests too.

Contributions and feedback are most welcome! 

You can find the full documentation and examples [here](http://byteally.github.io/webapi/)
